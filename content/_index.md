description: I am a PhD student at the University of Maryland [Entomology department](https://entomology.umd.edu/) in the [Burghardt Lab](https://www.karinburghardt.com/). I am interested in insect conservation, urban ecology, novel ecosystems, and plant-insect interactions. Specifically, I study how residential yard maintenance, such as leaf litter removal, affects insect community survival, composition, and dispersal. I also study the effects of long-term yard maintenance on soil carbon and decomposition. Check out the other tabs for research projects, extension work, and the occasional blog posting.
