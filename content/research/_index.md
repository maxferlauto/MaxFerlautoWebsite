  description: My dissertation is composed of five chapters. In the first chapter, I  quantify the effects of leaf litter removal on Lepidoptera and solitary wasps in urban residential properties. In the second chapter, I quantify Lepidoptera and solitary wasp emergence from a tree diversity experiment to understand if diverse plantings in yards where litter is removed act as population traps. In the third chapter, I assess if long term litter removal leads to legacy effects on soil carbon and decomposition. In my fourth chapter, I analyze the effect of litter manipulations on soil carbon and decomposition while looking at  interactions between tree diversity and leaf functional traits.. In the final chapter, I use least-cost modeling to explore how socio-economic factors correlate with insect functional connectivity and how to best prioritize outreach resources to create ecological corridors of residential properties.
