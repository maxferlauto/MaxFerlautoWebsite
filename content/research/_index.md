  description: "My dissertation is composed of five chapters. In the first chapter, I  quantify the effects of leaf litter removal on Lepidoptera and solitary wasps in urban residential properties. In the second chapter, I quantify Lepidoptera and solitary wasp emergence from a tree diversity experiment to understand if diverse plantings in yards where litter is removed act as population traps. In the third chapter, I assess if long term suburban litter removal leads to legacy effects on soil carbon and decomposition while looking at interactions between tree diversity and leaf functional traits. In the final chapter, I use least-cost modeling in ArcGIS to explore how socio-economic factors correlate with insect functional connectivity and how to best prioritize outreach resources to create ecological corridors of residential properties."
