Let's say you heard about how planting diverse native trees can support insect biodiversity in your backyard. So, you go to a nursery to buy a sycamore, a northern red oak, and a tulip tree. You plant the trees and let them grow. That autumn, you rake your leaves to the curb as always. Have you helped your insect species? Well, there is a chance that by raking away fallen leaf litter you have removed overwintering insects and their habitat. There will be nothing to repopulate the trees next year. This yard could be considered a trap for insect populations. They live it up in the summer only to be mulched or thrown into a municipal composter come fall. On the other hand, by planting a diverse set of trees you likely have a diverse set of insect species. In a diverse insect assemblage there is a higher chance of species that wonâ€™t be hurt by leaf litter removal. Your diverse tree planting mitigated the negative effects of removing leaf litter. This chapter seeks to understand if diverse plantings where litter removal occurs leads to an ecological trap or help conserve insect populations.

So, how do you study the effect of tree diversity and leaf litter removal on insect populations? Well, biodiversity studies can be tricky because you can't just compare homes with diverse trees to homes with fewer tree species. This is because the diverse homes have a higher chance of including a species that supports insects unusually well. You would be testing the species effect instead of the diversity effect. To properly study diversity you need to see how each species acts in a polyculture (diverse homes) compared to a monoculture (only one species). This is really difficult to do in suburbia. Therefore, I used a tree biodiversity experiment for this component of my research. I also wanted to study how alternate litter management strategies could be used to preserve insects so I included mulching and leaf piling treatments.

BiodiversiTREE is a large scale tree biodiversity experiment at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Maryland. Established in 2013, this research site is composed of 35x35m plots of 255 trees in diversity treatments of single species monocultures and 12 species polycultures. The polyculture and monoculture plots are paired based on location and soil type. I performed litter manipulations in both polyculture and monoculture plots in December. I controlled for differences in local conditions by using a block design to set up litter treatments. Each block consisted of a 1m square treatment of litter removal, mulching/shredding, addition, or control. I collected from traps every 10 days from March to July. This project continued for two years.
