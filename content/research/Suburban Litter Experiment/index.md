Residential landscaping can benefit native wildlife if ecologically friendly management techniques are utilized. Retaining autumn leaf litter is a commonly discussed method to protect overwintering beneficial insects like pollinators and natural enemies. However, there has been little research on this management technique. We know little about where these insects overwinter, when they emerge, or how far they travel to new sites. Some may overwinter directly in the leaf litter or soil. Some may emerge in early spring, while others emerge in June. Learning the life history of beneficial insects will help us protect them. Understanding the local conditions that overwintering insects desire will allow homeowners to create habitat and knowing the phenology of insects will help us time yard work to be least disturbing.

I worked with 20 homeowners between D.C and Baltimore to try and answer these questions. Homeowner yards were divided into sections based on the history of leaf litter management. An area where leaf litter was retained for a number of years was a unmaintained area whereas an area where litter was removed year after year was a maintained area. I created adjacent 1x1m plots within each of those sections. In November after leaf-fall, I either retained or removed leaf litter from the plots. In the spring, emergence traps were installed on top of each plot. I collected Lepidoptera (moths) and parasitoid wasps from the traps every ten days. This project was repeated for two years. This experimental design allows me to discover how leaf litter management affects yard areas of different maintenance intensities.

We are soon to publish this data. So far we are seeing that removing litter reduces Lepidoptera emergence by about 50%. This effect is generally consistent spring through summer. Litter removal also reduces the diversity of parasitoid wasps and changes the composition of their community.
